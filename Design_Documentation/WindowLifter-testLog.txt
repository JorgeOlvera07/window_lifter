Status:      	       UN-SPECIFIED

Comments:              * Manual button press validation does not work properly with this time constraint.
		       * In manual mode, the module waits to add the 500+ ms time constraint along with the 400ms time constraint with the
		         ledBar's state transition.
		       * Assumption proven with the next test: test ID xx - Digital Output Manual @ <= 900ms
		   
		  
ID-TEST NAME:          12-Digital Output Manual @ <= 900ms

Status:      	       PASS

Comments:              * Both manual modes work only by adding the 400ms ledBar time transition constraint to the 500ms button validation
                         mode constraint.
